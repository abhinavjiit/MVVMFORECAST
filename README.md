# MVVMFORECAST

#Ignore the movieDb project .
1. I have used dagger,kotlin,coroutines,ROOMDATABSE And MVVM for making this project.
2. First screen is all about hte current weather of your current location and also hourly data(weather).
3. Secand fragment is tommorrow weather for next 7 days.i have shown only max min temp and weather icon and date and humidity.
4.it works offline as well. by using roomDataBase but i have only used current weather data as of now ,nothing else .
and every after 15 min it will fetch the weather again (current).and for location i have used google play service location api.
